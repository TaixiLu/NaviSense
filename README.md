Project brief

This project is an ultrasonic distance sensor warning system designed to help visually impaired individuals move safely at home. 
The device is wearable, resembling a neckband or belt. It uses four ultrasonic sensors to cover different directions, detecting obstacles in real-time. The system can be operated using voice commands. 
It tracks the userâ€™s speed and adjusts its sensitivity. By adjusting the sensitivity, the trigger threshold of the warning system can be adjusted to avoid producing alarms too early or too late. The device also supports adjusting sensitivity manually using voice commands to give users more flexibility. 
Additionally, it estimates battery levels using the battery voltage to provide low battery warning.
