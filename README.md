AProject brief
This project aims to enhance the safety and independence of visually impaired individuals living alone by utilising assistive navigational tools. These tools will enable users to navigate their homes while minimising risks of injuries or accidents, using non-visual cues such as touch and sound. The solution will focus on integrating with existing tools, enabling seamless, independent navigation and allowing users to adapt to changes in their home environment. The system is designed to be user-friendly, easy to set up alone, and suitable for mid-level economy households. Additionally, the project aims to have consistent and dependable hazard detection, with reliable performance and effective communication of the surrounding environment to the user. Some key considerations include user control, ease of use, and integration into daily life without disrupting other technologies.
Problem space
Visually impaired individuals living independently face significant challenges and risks when navigating their homes. Simple tasks such as moving from one room to another or locating items can become daunting and result in injuries or accidents. Traditional methods of navigating rely heavily on memory, spatial awareness, and touch, but these are often not enough for ensuring safety, especially if they have only recently relocated or there are changes in the environment, such as during renovations. Furthermore, current assistive technologies can be tedious to use, requiring visual interfaces or complex setups, which is not very practical for visually impaired users. This emphasises the need for a more intuitive, user-friendly solution that provides real-time, non-visual guidance to enhance safety and independence within domestic environments. By developing a system that provides touch and auditory signals, we aim to bridge this gap, enabling our users to navigate their homes confidently and safely.
